#### error fields being weird?
- e.g.,:
```
POST
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/notifications/basic/
    {"message":"Daniel Nazarian (Entrepreneur2) is interested in your profile. Consider scheduling a meeting with them!","sender":"204c256f-e5bb-48d4-b512-510963b35e6e","recipients":["950997f1-4333-4aaa-baf4-48112440ba63"]}

{"recipients":["Not a valid string."],"message":"Error. Please try again later.","results":null,"error_fields":null}


why is 'recipients' a top level key?
```
- add it to the 'error_fields' key
